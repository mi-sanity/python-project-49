# Project "Mind Games"
- **brain-even**: the user is shown a random number and has to answer "yes" if the number is even or "no" if it is odd.
- **brain-calc**: the user is shown a random mathematical expression, e.g. "35 + 16", to calculate and record the correct answer.
- **brain-gcd**: the user is shown two random numbers, e.g. "25 50", and needs to calculate and enter the greatest common divisor of these numbers.
- **brain-progression**: the user is shown a series of numbers that form an arithmetic progression with a hidden number and needs to identify that number.
- **brain-prime**: the user is shown a random number and has to answer "yes" if the number is prime, otherwise the answer is "no".
